# Hey, nice to have you!

## This site is missing content!
Yes, that's most probably correct! Would you like to contribute some text, do graphics or videos? Record a podcasts? Just [get in contact](mailto:hallo@rmswing.de). We're super happy about new content and/or ideas!

## I found a bug! Something's broken! You could do better ...

If you have a Github account, we'de really appreciata a little issue report on our [frontend project](https://github.com/rhein-main-swingtime/frontend-hugo).

## I'm throwing Swing Dance parties, a concert or want to offer classes or a workshop.
Awesome! üöÄüôåü§© There is different things we can do:

* It's single **social** event or dedicated series: We add it to the calendar. Voil√†.
* Multiple **socials**, lots of changes: You get editor access to the calendar.
* You have a schedule with **classes**: Bring your own calendar and we include it or you get a dedicated one from us that you can edit.
