# Hey, nice to have you!

We run this site, because we like to dance, to tinker and we thing the Rhein-Main scene is just ‚ù§Ô∏è! Just like a good dance is fueled by the exchange of ideas, this page is as well. So we'd love to hear your's and we're always happy to receive some support too!

{{<info-contact>}}
**Contact us?** Generally yes please by e-mail or Signal!\
Only the core team is looking into the e-mails though and it might happen that something slips through to the Spam-filter. In the Signal-group are also many others that can edit the calendar events. So when it's about that and it's urgent better there! :)

## I'm throwing Swing Dance parties, a concert or want to offer classes or a workshop.
Awesome! üöÄüôåü§© There is different things we can do:

* It's single **social** event or dedicated series: We add it to the calendar. Voil√†.
* Multiple **socials**, lots of changes: You get editor access to the calendar.
* You have a schedule with **classes**: Bring your own calendar and we include it or you get a dedicated one from us that you can edit.

In any case we're happy to hear what you're up to! Just send us all needed information and off we go! Important would be:
* name of the event
* date und times (beginning and important!: **end or duration** (or we just write anything))
* frequencies (if applicable, every 2 weeks, 1st Sunday ...)
* description text (please: rather compact if possible!)
* links, Facebook-events, fees, prices ...

Please **don't send pictures**! At the moment we have no use for these. That may be available in a future version of the page ;]


## This site is missing content!
Yes, that's most probably correct! Would you like to contribute some text, do graphics or videos? Record a podcasts? Just get in contact. We're super happy about new content and/or ideas!


## I found a bug! Something's broken! You could do better ...
Talk to us at a social dance, or drop us a line via mail or Signal.
